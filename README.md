# Mini-Amazon

We have decided to work on the standard project option. Since the last milestone, we have started discussing how we will work as a team to complete this project. We have also set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sam-B-Y/Mini-Amazon/) to collaborate, and a group chat to discuss issues and progress.
